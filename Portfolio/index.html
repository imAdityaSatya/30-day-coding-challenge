    <h1>Aditya Satya</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Aditya Satya. I am an enthusiastic and determined person, despite being an ambivert. Born and raised in the culturally rich city of Darbhanga, that's where I completed my schooling before pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from ITER Bhubaneswar.</p> 
    
    <p>Turns out my life would be as monotonic as coding by day and dreaming by night, though sometimes opposite, right? Wrong. Well I do have some interests/hobbies too. And they extend beyond the typical reading books or listening to music. Like, I am an avid cricket enthusiast, be it playing or watching. Additionally, I enjoy writing as well, mostly poetic and random. I would also include walking as it helps me unwind and reflect.</p> 

    <p>Given the breathtaking technical advances in this day and age, it is worth reminding that there is a life beyond the digital realm. Devices are getting smarter while we humans the opposite. And here I am eager to carve out a meaningful career in the IT sector itself. Can't say which road I'll end up on but it'd be great even if I could better the lives of people by just 1 percent.</p> 
        
    <p>As I look forward to add value to this dynamic world around me, you're welcome to scroll down and look at my complete portfolio. Happy exploring!
